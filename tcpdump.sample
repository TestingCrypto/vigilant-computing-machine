{if} not installed with the Distro (command-line network watchING)
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
sudo apt-get install tcpdump
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
sudo ifconfig
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3

2-Find Traffic Using Ports and Port Ranges

in this way you can capture traffic on specific ports or from ports ranges. lets give  een example to find traffic on port 80
	
root@osradar-mint:~# tcpdump port 80
root@osradar-mint:~# tcpdump portrange 80-444
3-Find Traffic Based on Packet Size

Are you looking for packets of a particular size themn use these options. You can use options like less, greater,
	
# tcpdump less 16
# tcpdump greater 128
# tcpdump <= 8

4-Find Traffic by IP

One of the most common queries, this will show you traffic from 8.8.8.8 whether itâ€™s the source or the destination.

4-1-Filtering by Source and Destination
	
# tcpdump host 8.8.8.8

isolate traffic based on either source or destination using src and dst options.
	
# tcpdump src 10.0.0.1
# tcpdump dst 10.0.0.254

4-2-Finding Packets by Network

To find packets going to or from a particular network,
	
# tcpdump net 192.168.2.0/24
5-Capture and Save Packets in a File and read from file 

5-1-capture and save packets into a file

user (Control+c) to  interrupt  saving
	
# tcpdump -w file1.pcap -i enp0s3

sudo tcpdump port 80
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
tcpdump -r file1.pcap
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
tcpdump -c 9 -i enp0s3
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
tcpdump -XX -i enp0s3
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
tcpdump  'tcp[(tcp[12]>>2):4] = 0x5353482D'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
tcpdump -s 0 -A -n -l | egrep -i "POST /|pwd=|passwd=|password=|Host:"
